I am an emerging security analyst interested in threat detection, malware analysis, and defensive/offensive security.


## Objective
My journey as an entry level security analyst has led me to hone my skills in critical thinking and problem solving. My goal is to acquire the ComptTIA Security+ certification to demonstrate my dedication and passion for cybersecurity.
