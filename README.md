I am an emerging security analyst interested in threat detection, malware analysis, and defensive/offensive security. I am a professional, dedicated, and persistent security analyst with 4+ years of experience with medication management platforms and assessing security posture including physical and network infrastructure. I am open and willing to learn and engage in new techniques including offensive and defensive security concepts. Seeking to leverage and expand my knowledge and experience in the emerging ever-changing security landscape.


## Objective
My journey as a security analyst has led me to hone my skills in critical thinking and problem solving. I will be documenting my progress and on hands training. My goal is to acquire the ComptTIA Security+ certification to demonstrate my dedication and passion for cybersecurity.
